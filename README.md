# Desktop-Notifier
we import the notification module from plyer which allows us to display desktop notifications. We also import the time module to introduce time-related functionality, specifically to add a delay between notifications.
if __name__ == '__main__':
This line checks whether the script is being run directly or if it's being imported as a module. If it's the main script being executed, the code block beneath it will run.
while True:

This creates an infinite loop. Inside this loop, notifications will be displayed repeatedly until the program is interrupted manually.
This block of code uses the notification.notify() function to display a desktop notification. It takes several parameters:

title: The title of the notification.
message: The message content of the notification.
app_icon: The path to the icon file that will be displayed with the notification.
timeout: The time, in seconds, for which the notification will be displayed. After this time, the notification will automatically disappear.

After displaying a notification, the program waits for the specified time before displaying the next one. In this case, it waits for 1 hour (60 minutes * 60 seconds) before displaying the next notification.

Repeat: Since this code is inside an infinite loop (while True:), steps 4 and 5 will repeat indefinitely, ensuring that notifications are displayed at regular intervals until the program is manually stopped.
